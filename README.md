# ARMagic
The application was created as a diploma thesis at the University of Pardubice. The application demonstrates the possibilities of augmented reality offered by ARCore technology. 
Along with the application, a custom data storage server was also designed and presented. This app is detailly described on thesis here: https://hdl.handle.net/10195/82362.

This application is divided into four parts, each focusing on one of the possibilities of augmented reality. Due to the use of ARCore technology to work with augmented reality on the Android operating system, these options were limited compared to ARKit. Additionally, when using ARKit, it would be possible to perform object recognition or body recognition. The main capabilities that ARCore offers and have been used in the app include marker,
face and horizontal surface recognition. To save storage on the device, a server was also designed to store data in the form of 3D models, their configurations and videos. To display the 3D models, the application uses models in GLB format.
